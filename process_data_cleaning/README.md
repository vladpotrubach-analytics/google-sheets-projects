Google Sheets – Data Cleaning Practice
(Google Data Analytics Certificate)

This section summarizes my practice with Google Sheets during the "Process Data from Dirty to Clean" stage of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

The focus was on understanding data quality issues and learning how to prepare datasets for accurate analysis as part of the analytics process.

What I practiced
1. Identifying dirty data
Missing and blank values
Duplicate records
Inconsistent text formats
Incorrect data types
Outliers and obvious errors
2. Cleaning data in Google Sheets
Removing duplicates
Filtering out invalid or incomplete rows
Standardizing text values
Fixing date and number formats
Using conditional formatting to detect issues
3. Common functions and tools
TRIM, CLEAN
LEFT, RIGHT, MID
LEN
COUNTIF
Filters and sorting
Basic formulas for validation
4. Preparing data for analysis
Making datasets consistent and readable
Ensuring correct column types
Structuring tables for further analysis
Understanding how poor data quality affects insights
Business context
These practices help answer questions such as:

Can this dataset be trusted for decision-making?
Are metrics distorted due to duplicates or missing data?
Is the data suitable for analysis and reporting?
What risks exist if dirty data is used in analysis?
Learning outcome
This practice helped me understand that data cleaning is a critical step in analytics and directly impacts the quality of insights, reports, and business decisions.

The main goal was developing a systematic approach to evaluating and cleaning real-world datasets.
